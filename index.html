        <p>
            Not satisfied until I get close to the sun.</p>
            <p>Born, raised, and dying in New Jersey. I was drawn to technology from a very young age, hacking Dreamcast and playing Scorched Earth on DOS. Through video games and computers, I found solace in software, hardware, and art, and science. I stand at the gate of them all.
