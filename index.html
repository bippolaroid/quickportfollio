            <p>Born, raised, living, and dying in New Jersey; I'm a designer and developer looking for the next challenge.</p>
            <p>I was fascinated with tech at a very young age hacking Dreamcast and PS2 games, playing Scorched Earth on DOS, and taking apart the family PC. I began creating assets for creators on different gaming forums, which led to my passion for graphic design.
                <p>Through video games and computers, I found solace in software, hardware, art, and science. I now stand at the gate of them all.</p>
